# Diabetes-pridiction-end-to-end-ml-project
In this app basically people have to spicify their age,Glucose rate in their body,BMI,Insulin in the body and pregnancies.Then the mechine learning model will predict the person has Diabetes or not.
Data set is take form kaggle which is basically an real time dataset.
This is a mechine learing project which is deployed in heroku.
Algorithm used in this project is Random Forest Classifier.
Mechine learning pipe line steps are used in this project.
  1.Feature anlaysis:finding missing values,numerical,catagorical values and outliers.
  2.Feature Engneering
  3:Feature Selection:We have used chi square test and mutual information for feartutre selection.
  4:Model:Random forest classifier, we have done hyperparameter tuning for this using random search cv,grid search cv and genetic algorithms and the accuracy we are touching is      nearly 83 percent.
  5.Deployment:We are deploying our model in Heroku Colud Platform.The web frame work used in this project is flask.The link for this Diabetes prediction app is
